# Node: patch

**Verb:** TDD via coder
**Capability:** spawn `ruver-fd-coder` (or run that contract inline if
this job is already a depth-1 worker)

Orchestrator **does not** write product code. Same PR. Same branch.
No new PR. Draft stays draft. No merge.

## Before the coder

[DECISION_POLICY.md](../../../engines/ruver-feature-delivery/DECISION_POLICY.md).
DECIDE by default. Do not ping the user.

**Complicated** (run [grill.md](grill.md) first) if any:

- auth / tenant / PII / money / public API / permission
- new module, type, or endpoint
- more than two behavioral files, or the root cause is still fuzzy
- TDD would need a redesign
- two designs still look equally right after lookup

**Simple** (skip grill): one localized change, the review already names
the trigger and the fix, a neighbor pattern exists.

Grill ASK → `waiting_user`, stop. Resume continues here.

## Coder

Follow [implement.md](../../../engines/ruver-feature-delivery/nodes/implement.md) +
[TDD.md](../../../engines/ruver-feature-delivery/TDD.md). One should-fix slice at a
time. Fresh `ruver-fd-coder` per slice.

Inject: finding + disposition, grill decisions if any, file whitelist,
TDD RED/GREEN, same branch. Forbidden: production code before RED,
other tickets, merge, new PR.

Worker lane (cannot spawn): run [coder.md](../../../engines/ruver-feature-delivery/nodes/coder.md)
inline. TDD still required. Do not skip because the slice is small.

`NEEDS_CONTEXT` → parent DECIDE from the review + repo. ASK only last
resort.

Then **reply**.
