# Node: request_qa

**Verb:** switch or enqueue  
**Capability:** write bus only

Mandatory after CI green, MERGEABLE, and **bot_review** skip or pass.
Do not stop at "delivered".

Write `QA_REQUEST` ([../references/QA_HANDOFF.md](../references/QA_HANDOFF.md))
to `.ruver-bus/jobs/<job_id>/qa-request.md`. PR link + `job_id` required.

Then **Enqueue or start QA** (`ruver-bus/JOBS.md`):

- Slot free → copy to `ENVELOPE.md`, bus switch to `qa`.
- Slot taken → append `qa_waiting`. Do not switch. Do not
  spawn `ruver_qa`. Tell the user their queue position (in English).

QA must still comment + video before **this job** is done.
