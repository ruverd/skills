- Skills spirit: loop-on-ci, fix-ci

## Must

1. `gh pr checks` is source of truth (all PR-attached checks).
2. Poll with SHORT calls (`gh pr checks --json name,bucket,state,link`) on an interval
   sized to the repo's CI (poll, no assumed duration). NEVER rely on
   `gh pr checks --watch` finishing inside one tool call (10-min Bash cap) —
   a killed watch is NOT a CI failure; re-check.
3. On fail: diagnose (extract first actionable failure), then dispatch a FRESH
   `ruver-fd-coder` subagent with the fix slice — do NOT edit product code yourself
   (Write/Edit are for STATE only). Push via the coder, re-check.
4. Cap fix loops (`ci_fix_loops`, default 5); then escalate with real check links.
4. **Never** mark delivery complete while any required/attached check is fail or pending.
5. Never merge. Never invent green status.
6. Fullstack: both PRs must be green.
7. User-facing status in English.

Return: result green|escalated, pr_url, checks_summary, fix_loops_used.
